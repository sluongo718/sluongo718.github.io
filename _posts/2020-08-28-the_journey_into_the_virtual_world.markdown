lets say Alians came to earth and say what is code??? well we live on a physical world and about 50 years ago a group of people got togather and created another world. but they didn't create another physical world but a virtual world. and when you think about it the people in the physical world also live and control there lifes with this vitural world. humans will adapt to there enviorment. every year we get more and more in to this virtual world. we use it to keep in touch with each other. keeping important information about our lifes. using thing to just make human to live more easy. 20 years ago people said having a computer isn't a need.... well i mean if you said that today people will just look at you like you woke up from a 20 year coma. with all that being said every year we see more and more jobs becoming a things we are losing physical jobs. and massively gaining vitual jobs. and i think that is something strongly to consider for our futer career
