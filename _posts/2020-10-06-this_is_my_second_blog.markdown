the cli project was a lil Intimidating. we had to think for out selfs and make a new program out of nothing. some things i would tell myself before starting this part of the cousre is to read and go over every topic slowly untill you understand it fully. initialize was a tricky one for me it seemed like a easy concept to understand but how i look at it now is its kinda like a gateway in to your code. so like if the program was a hospital and you were working in the baby Delivery ward. every time a baby is born it is an object in our hospital(program). it exist now in out program. but when you initialize we can give it a attribute like a name cause i mean having a first and last name will help to organize all the babys in the hospital. so instead of looking up a baby by its object id we can just look it up by its name and that would be more reasonable way to personalize our program. then latter on when the baby leaves the hospitla and starts to grow up we can give it more attributes by adding setters and getters and add on to out object so we can have full details on that object. details meaning attributes
