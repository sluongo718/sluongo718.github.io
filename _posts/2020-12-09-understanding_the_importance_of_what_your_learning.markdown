the sinatra project...

the sinatra project was an interesting one. at first it didnt seem to hard to understand it mostly it taking alot of steps but the steps are little and there are just alot of them. by the end of the sinatra section it started to feel Intimidating. but once i got it started it started to feel more confident in finishing the project. so what i mean is by the title of this blog is learning the importance of what your learning. for the next part of this course the rails section i plan on looking at the project requirements before hand to get and idea one what the main parts are to pay attention to. not to say that every thing we are learning is not important but it can help to undaerstand what the big parts are of this section to learn and take away with after you finsih that section in the course. so if anyone does Actually read this so important things to take away from the sinatra project is...

database: there is alot that goes on in the database but one main thing to learn on them is how they talk to each other in the has many and the belongs to relationship. the Foreign key is a must

syntax: there are alot of differnt type so inputs, tags, etc so learning on what pages to use them on is key point 

routes: the most thing to take away from sinatra is the routes and learning on how they will connect to one another erb pages and links on which way to go

IDS: every object has an id where it is on the side of the belongs to or the has many side of it and when tyring to find objects one main thing is to find_by_id why ...cause all onjects has one

good luck in sinatra!
